We also provided a MindSpore version of our code: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kEjKtYYSwvzHCzDh_4niew (passwords: 37ne). 

ðŸŒˆWe released a survey on deep learning-based low-light image enhancement------- Low-Light Image and Video Enhancement Using Deep Learning: A Survey, an online platform, a new dataset. Have fun! https://github.com/Li-Chongyi/Lighting-the-Darkness-in-the-Deep-Learning-Era-Open. 

# Pytorch
Pytorch implementation of Zero-DCE++

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7 
2. Pytorch 1.0.0
3. opencv
4. torchvision 0.2.1
5. cuda 10.0

Zero-DCE++ does not need special configurations. Just basic environment. 

Or you can create a conda environment to run our code like this:
conda create --name zerodce++_env opencv pytorch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1 cuda100 python=3.7 -c pytorch

### Folder structure
Download the Zero-DCE++ first.
The following shows the basic folder structure.
```

â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_data 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train_data 
â”œâ”€â”€ lowlight_test.py # testing code
â”œâ”€â”€ lowlight_train.py # training code
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py # Zero-DEC++ network
â”œâ”€â”€ dataloader.py
â”œâ”€â”€ snapshots_Zero_DCE++
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Epoch99.pth #  A pre-trained snapshot (Epoch99.pth)
```
### Test: 

cd Zero-DCE++
```
python lowlight_test.py 
```
The script will process the images in the sub-folders of "test_data" folder and make a new folder "result" in the "data". You can find the enhanced images in the "result" folder.

### Train: 
cd Zero-DCE++

```
python lowlight_train.py 
```
