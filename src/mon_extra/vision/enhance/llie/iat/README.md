**2023.5.11:** Thanks for [this issue](https://github.com/cuiziteng/Illumination-Adaptive-Transformer/issues/44)'s correction, the Flops of IAT on (256 x 256) image is 1.44 *GFlops*, and the Flops of IAT on (400 x 600) image is 5.28 *GFlops*, please notice. Also the 0.004s per image inference speed is calculated in LOL-V2 dataset inference (100 images total), if you only test single image, the inference speed would be slow down because of GPU's effect (the initial images evaluation time would be larger).

**2023.3.2:** Renew the [img_demo.py](https://github.com/cuiziteng/Illumination-Adaptive-Transformer/blob/main/IAT_enhance/img_demo.py), you can directly use this for image enhancement and exposure correction.

**2022.10.16:** We add demos for low-light enhancement and exposure correction in [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Andy1621/IAT_enhancement).

**2022.10.11:** Upload the low-light semantic segmentation code. See [segmentation](https://github.com/cuiziteng/Illumination-Adaptive-Transformer/tree/main/IAT_high/IAT_mmseg).

**2022.10.1:** Papar accepted by [**BMVC 2022**](https://bmvc2022.mpi-inf.mpg.de/238/)!

**2022.8.10:** Upload **LOL-V1** dataset training code.

**2022.8.3:** Upload the new [arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14871), the rewnewed results on **LOL-V1** dataset (485 training images, 15 testing images) is **23.38** PSNR and **0.809** SSIM, the results on **LOL-V2-real** dataset (689 training images, 100 testing images) is **23.50** PSNR and **0.824** SSIM. Detail see this [issue](https://github.com/cuiziteng/Illumination-Adaptive-Transformer/issues/7).

**2022.7.11:** Upload the low-light object detection code. See [detection](https://github.com/cuiziteng/Illumination-Adaptive-Transformer/tree/main/IAT_high/IAT_mmdetection).

## Abstract

Challenging illumination conditions (low-light, under-exposure and over-exposure) in the real world not only cast an unpleasant visual appearance but also taint the computer vision tasks. After camera captures the raw-RGB data, it renders standard sRGB images with image signal processor (ISP). By decomposing ISP pipeline into local and global image components, we propose a lightweight fast **Illumination Adaptive Transformer (IAT)** to restore the normal lit sRGB image from either low-light or under/over-exposure conditions. Specifically, **IAT** uses attention queries to represent and adjust the ISP-related parameters such as colour correction, gamma correction. With only **～90k** parameters and **～0.004s** processing speed, our **IAT** consistently achieves superior performance over SOTA on the current benchmark low-light enhancement and exposure correction datasets. Competitive experimental performance also demonstrates that our **IAT** significantly enhances object detection and semantic segmentation tasks under various light conditions.

For Vision Tasks under various lighting conditions, towards both **Human Vision** :smile:  and **Machine Vision** :camera:

Our IAT model consist of two individual branches, the local branch is for pixel-wise adjustment and ouputs two feature map for add and multiply. The global branch is for global-wise adjustment and outputs the color matrix and gamma value, global branch is inspired by [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), the network would updates color matrix and gamma value by a dynamic query learning way. BTW, the total model is only over **90k+** parameters and the inference speed is only **0.004s** per image on LOL dataset (single Nvidia-3090 GPU).

## Usage:

Enviroment (install pytorch 1.7.1 or later, following [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).):
```
$ conda create -n IAT python==3.7.0
$ conda activate IAT
$ conda install --yes -c pytorch pytorch=1.7.1 torchvision cudatoolkit=11.0
$ pip install timm matplotlib IQA_pytorch tqdm
```

For low-level vision (low-light enhancement, exposure correction):
```
cd IAT_enhance
```

For high-level vision (low-light detection, low-light semantic segmentation):
```
cd IAT_high
```
