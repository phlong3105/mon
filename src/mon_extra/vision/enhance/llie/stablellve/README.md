# StableLLVE
This is a Pytorch implementation of "Learning Temporal Consistency for Low Light Video Enhancement from Single Images" in CVPR 2021, by Fan Zhang, Yu Li, Shaodi You and Ying Fu.

## Requirements ##
- [x] python 3.6.9
- [x] Pytorch 1.5.0
- [x] opencv-python 3.4.2

## Usage ##
#### Training
First, prepare your own traning data and put it in the folder `./data`. By default, the code takes input images and ground truth from `./data/train` and `./data/gt` and you can also change the path in `train.py` and `dataloader.py`.

Second, you need to predict plausible optical flow for your ground truth images and put it in the folder `./data/flow`. In our paper, we first perform instance segmentation to get object masks using the opensource toolkit **[detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)**. Then we utilize the pretrained **[CMP](https://github.com/XiaohangZhan/conditional-motion-propagation)** model to generate the optical flow we need. 

**Update**:
- [x] The prediction code and example images now are released in `etc` folder.
- [ ] The noise generation code to be updated.

Finally, you can train models on your own data by running
```shell
cd StableLLVE
python train.py 
```
You can replace the U-Net with your own model for low light image enhancement. The model will be saved in the folder `./logs`.

#### Testing
You can put your test images into the folder `./data/test` and just run
```shell
cd StableLLVE
python test.py
```

## Model ##
- [x] checkpoint.pth (This model is trained with the synthetic clean data reported in the paper. It may be unsuitable for noisy data.)
