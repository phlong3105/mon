### Flare7K++
**Flare7K++**, the first comprehensive nighttime flare removal dataset, consists of 962 real-captured flare images (**Flare-R**) and 7,000 synthetic flares (**Flare7K**). **Flare7K** is generated based on the observation and statistic of real-world nighttime lens flares. It offers 5,000 scattering flare images and 2,000 reflective flare images, consisting of 25 types of scattering flares and 10 types of reflective flares. **Flare-R** is captured by smartphone rear cameras with different lens contaminants in the dark room. These flare patterns can be randomly added to the flare-free images, forming the flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs.

### Update

Flare7K offers 5,000 scattering flare images and 2,000 reflective flare images, consisting of 25 types of scattering flares and 10 types of reflective flares.

It contains 645 images captured by different cameras and some images are very challenging. |

### Paired Data Generation

We provide a on-the-fly dataloader function and a flare-corrupted/flare-free pairs generation script in this repository. To use this function, please put the Flare7K dataset and 24K Flickr dataset on the same path with the `generate_flare.ipynb` file.

If you only want to generate the flare-corrupted image without reflective flare, you can comment out the following line:
```
# flare_image_loader.load_reflective_flare('Flare7K','Flare7k/Reflective_Flare')
```


### Pretrained Model

The inference code based on Uformer is released Now. Your can download the pretrained checkpoints from the following links. Please place it under the `experiments` folder and unzip it, then you can run the `test.py` for inference. We provide two checkpoints for models training on Flare7K, the model in the folder `uformer` can help remove both the reflective flares and scattering flares. The `uformer_noreflection` one can only help remove the scattering flares but is more robust. Now, we prefer the users to test our new model trained on Flare7K++, it can achieve better results and more realistic light source.

### Inference Code
To estimate the flare-free images with our checkpoint pretrained on Flare7K++, you can run the `test.py` or `test_large.py` (for image larger than 512*512) by using:
```
python test_large.py --input dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/input --output result/test_real/flare7kpp/ --model_path experiments/flare7kpp/net_g_last.pth --flare7kpp
```
If you use our checkpoint pretrained on Flare7K, please run:
```
python test_large.py --input dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/input --output result/test_real/flare7k/ --model_path experiments/flare7k/net_g_last.pth
```

### Evaluation Code
To calculate different metrics with our pretrained model, you can run the `evaluate.py` by using:
```
python evaluate.py --input result/blend/ --gt dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/gt/ --mask dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/mask/
```

### Training model

**Training with single GPU**

To train a model with your own data/model, you can edit the `options/uformer_flare7k_option.yml` and run the following codes. You can also add `--debug` command to start the debug mode:

```
python basicsr/train.py -opt options/uformer_flare7k_option.yml
```
If you want to use Flare7K++ for training, please use:
```
python basicsr/train.py -opt options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml
```

**Training with multiple GPU**

You can run the following command for the multiple GPU tranining:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 bash scripts/dist_train.sh 2 options/uformer_flare7k_option.yml
```
If you want to use Flare7K++ for training, please use:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 bash scripts/dist_train.sh 2 options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml
```
