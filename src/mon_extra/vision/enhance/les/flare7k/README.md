### Flare7K++
**Flare7K++**, the first comprehensive nighttime flare removal dataset, consists of 962 real-captured flare images (**Flare-R**) and 7,000 synthetic flares (**Flare7K**). **Flare7K** is generated based on the observation and statistic of real-world nighttime lens flares. It offers 5,000 scattering flare images and 2,000 reflective flare images, consisting of 25 types of scattering flares and 10 types of reflective flares. **Flare-R** is captured by smartphone rear cameras with different lens contaminants in the dark room. These flare patterns can be randomly added to the flare-free images, forming the flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs.

### Update

Flare7K offers 5,000 scattering flare images and 2,000 reflective flare images, consisting of 25 types of scattering flares and 10 types of reflective flares. Flare-R offers 962 real-captured flare patterns. |

We filter our most of the flare-corrupted images and overexposed images.|

It contains 645 images captured by different cameras and some images are very challenging. |

### Paired Data Generation

We provide a on-the-fly dataloader function and a flare-corrupted/flare-free pairs generation script in this repository. To use this function, please put the Flare7K dataset and 24K Flickr dataset on the same path with the `generate_flare.ipynb` file.

If you only want to generate the flare-corrupted image without reflective flare, you can comment out the following line:
```
# flare_image_loader.load_reflective_flare('Flare7K','Flare7k/Reflective_Flare')
```


### Pretrained Model

The inference code based on Uformer is released Now. Your can download the pretrained checkpoints from the following links. Please place it under the `experiments` folder and unzip it, then you can run the `test.py` for inference. We provide two checkpoints for models training on Flare7K, the model in the folder `uformer` can help remove both the reflective flares and scattering flares. The `uformer_noreflection` one can only help remove the scattering flares but is more robust. Now, we prefer the users to test our new model trained on Flare7K++, it can achieve better results and more realistic light source.

### Inference Code
To estimate the flare-free images with our checkpoint pretrained on Flare7K++, you can run the `test.py` or `test_large.py` (for image larger than 512*512) by using:
```
python test_large.py --input dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/input --output result/test_real/flare7kpp/ --model_path experiments/flare7kpp/net_g_last.pth --flare7kpp
```
If you use our checkpoint pretrained on Flare7K, please run:
```
python test_large.py --input dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/input --output result/test_real/flare7k/ --model_path experiments/flare7k/net_g_last.pth
```

### Evaluation Code
To calculate different metrics with our pretrained model, you can run the `evaluate.py` by using:
```
python evaluate.py --input result/blend/ --gt dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/gt/ --mask dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/mask/
```

### Training model

**Training with single GPU**

To train a model with your own data/model, you can edit the `options/uformer_flare7k_option.yml` and run the following codes. You can also add `--debug` command to start the debug mode:

```
python basicsr/train.py -opt options/uformer_flare7k_option.yml
```
If you want to use Flare7K++ for training, please use:
```
python basicsr/train.py -opt options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml
```

**Training with multiple GPU**

You can run the following command for the multiple GPU tranining:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 bash scripts/dist_train.sh 2 options/uformer_flare7k_option.yml
```
If you want to use Flare7K++ for training, please use:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 bash scripts/dist_train.sh 2 options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml
```
