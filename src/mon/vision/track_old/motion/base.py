"""This module implements the base class for all motion models.

Notes:
    Discussion 01: Should we go with Mixin or Composition approach?
        - Mixin:
            - Adv.:
                - Clear behaviour of the moving object.
            - Dis-adv.:
                - Cannot change behavior (if we want for some reasons) at
                  runtime.
                - If we want to assign multiple motion models to a moving object
                  type, we must define several sub-classes.
                
        - Composition:
            - Adv.:
                - Can dynamically change the behavior at runtime.
            - Dis adv.:
                - Must provide a way to create the moving object with an
                  appropriate motion. We should write a factory function or use
                  the Factory approach.
