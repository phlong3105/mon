## Method
![Main_Fig.](assets/main_figure.png)
We propose the unsupervised low-light image enhancement problem by reframing discrete iterative curve-adjustment methods into a continuous space using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE).

## Evaluation

Download the pre-trained [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E1Oi89TJeZIL4pz7d4p-D_Yq1rAG4Uhc?usp=drive_link) and place it in ``./pth/``.

```bash
# In inference.py, only modify the following paths:
# file_path: Path to the input images
# gt_path: Path to the ground truth images
# file_path = '/path/to/your/input'
# gt_path = '/path/to/your/corresponding_gt'

$ python inference.py
```

## User Controllablity
![Main_Fig.](assets/user_control.png)

CLODE learns the low-light exposure adjustment mechanism in the continuous-space, and is trained to output $I_T$ by integrating the states from $0$ to $T$ using a fixed $T=3$. However, users can manually adjust the integration interval by changing the final state value $T$ at the test stage, allowing them to output images with the preferred exposure level and even produce images darker than the input. In practice, by controlling the final state from $-(T+\Delta t)$ to $(T+\Delta t)$, the exposure level of the output image can be easily controlled to provide a more user-friendly exposure level. 

```bash
$ python inference.py --T 4.8    # set to 3.5, more brighten
$ python inference.py --T -1.4   # set to -1.4, more darken
$ python inference.py --T 2.5    # set to 2.5, Adjust to the brightness desired by the user
```
