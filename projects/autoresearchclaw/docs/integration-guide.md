# AutoResearchClaw Integration Guide

> **The simplest way to use AutoResearchClaw**: give the repo URL to [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and say *"Research [your topic]."* That's it — OpenClaw handles cloning, installing, configuring, and running the entire 23-stage pipeline for you.

This guide is for humans who want to understand what's happening under the hood, or who prefer to set things up manually.

## 1. The Easy Way: OpenClaw

If you use [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) as your AI assistant, you don't need to read the rest of this guide.

### Steps

1. Share the GitHub repo URL with OpenClaw:
   ```
   https://github.com/aiming-lab/AutoResearchClaw
   ```
2. OpenClaw reads `RESEARCHCLAW_AGENTS.md` and `README.md` — it now understands the entire system.
   > **Note:** `RESEARCHCLAW_AGENTS.md` is generated locally and listed in `.gitignore`. If it doesn't exist, OpenClaw can bootstrap from `README.md` and the project structure.
3. Say something like:
   ```
   Research the application of graph neural networks in drug discovery
   ```
4. OpenClaw will:
   - Clone the repo
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (`pip install -e .`)
   - Copy `config.researchclaw.example.yaml` → `config.yaml`
   - Ask you for an OpenAI API key (or use your environment variable)
   - Run the full 23-stage pipeline
   - Return the paper, experiment code, charts, and citations

**That's the whole process.** OpenClaw is designed to read agent definition files and bootstrap itself. AutoResearchClaw ships with these files specifically so that any OpenClaw-compatible AI assistant can pick it up and run.

### What if I want to tweak settings?

Tell OpenClaw in natural language:

- *"Use GPT-5.2 instead of GPT-4o"*
- *"Run experiments in sandbox mode, not simulated"*
- *"Target ICLR 2025 format instead of NeurIPS"*
- *"Skip the quality gate, just auto-approve everything"*

OpenClaw will modify `config.yaml` accordingly before running the pipeline.

## 2. Manual Setup

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Python** | 3.11 or newer |
| **LLM API** | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenAI, Azure, local proxy, etc.) |
| **Disk space** | ~100 MB for the repo + artifacts per run |
| **Network** | Required for LLM API calls and literature search (Semantic Scholar, arXiv) |

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aiming-lab/AutoResearchClaw.git
cd AutoResearchClaw

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check the CLI is available
researchclaw --help

# Validate your configuration
researchclaw validate --config config.yaml
```

---

## 3. Configuration Walkthrough

Start from the provided template:

```bash
cp config.researchclaw.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Open `config.yaml` in your editor. Here's what each section does:

### LLM Settings (Required)

This is the only section you **must** configure. Everything else has sensible defaults.

```yaml
llm:
  base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"     # Your LLM API endpoint
  api_key_env: "OPENAI_API_KEY"              # Environment variable name...
  api_key: ""                                # ...or paste the key directly here
  primary_model: "gpt-4o"                    # Model to use (gpt-4o, gpt-5.2, etc.)
  fallback_models:                           # Tried in order if primary fails
    - "gpt-4.1"
    - "gpt-4o-mini"
  s2_api_key: ""                             # Optional: Semantic Scholar API key for higher rate limits
```

**Using an environment variable** (recommended for security):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

**Using a direct key** (simpler, less secure):
```yaml
llm:
  api_key: "sk-your-key-here"
```

**Using a proxy or alternative provider**:
```yaml
llm:
  base_url: "https://your-proxy.example.com/v1"
  api_key: "your-proxy-key"
  primary_model: "gpt-4o"    # Must be supported by your endpoint
```

### Research Settings

```yaml
research:
  topic: "Your research topic here"    # Can also be set via CLI --topic flag
  domains:
    - "machine-learning"               # Guides literature search scope
  daily_paper_count: 10                # Target papers to collect
  quality_threshold: 4.0               # Minimum paper quality score (1-5)
```

### Experiment Settings

```yaml
experiment:
  mode: "sandbox"              # How experiments run (see Section 7)
  time_budget_sec: 300         # Max seconds per experiment run
  max_iterations: 10           # Max refinement loops in Stage 13
  metric_key: "primary_metric" # What metric to optimize
  metric_direction: "minimize" # "minimize" or "maximize"
  sandbox:
    python_path: ".venv/bin/python3"   # Python binary for sandbox execution
    gpu_required: false
    max_memory_mb: 4096
```

### Export Settings

```yaml
export:
  target_conference: "neurips_2025"   # See Section 8 for all available templates
  authors: "Anonymous"                 # Author line in the paper
  bib_file: "references"              # BibTeX file name (without .bib)
```

### Everything Else (Optional)

These have reasonable defaults. Change them only if you need to:

```yaml
project:
  name: "my-research"      # Just an identifier for your run
  mode: "full-auto"         # "docs-first", "semi-auto", or "full-auto"

runtime:
  timezone: "America/New_York"
  max_parallel_tasks: 3
  approval_timeout_hours: 12
  retry_limit: 2

security:
  hitl_required_stages: [5, 9, 20]     # Stages that pause for human approval
  allow_publish_without_approval: false

notifications:
  channel: "console"        # "console", "discord", or "slack"

knowledge_base:
  backend: "markdown"
  root: "docs/kb"
```

---

## 4. Running the Pipeline

### Basic Run

```bash
# Run with topic from config.yaml
researchclaw run --config config.yaml --auto-approve

# Override topic from command line
researchclaw run --config config.yaml --topic "Transformer attention for time series" --auto-approve
```

### CLI Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `researchclaw run` | Run the full 23-stage pipeline |
| `researchclaw validate` | Check your config file for errors |
| `researchclaw doctor` | Diagnose environment issues (Python, dependencies, API connectivity) |
| `researchclaw report --run-dir <path>` | Generate a human-readable summary of a completed run |

### Run Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--topic "..."` | Override the topic in config.yaml |
| `--config path` | Config file path (default: `config.yaml`) |
| `--output path` | Output directory (default: `artifacts/<run-id>/`) |
| `--auto-approve` | Skip manual approval at gate stages (5, 9, 20) |
| `--from-stage STAGE_NAME` | Start from a specific stage (e.g., `PAPER_OUTLINE`) |
| `--resume` | Resume from the last checkpoint |
| `--skip-preflight` | Skip LLM connectivity check before starting |
| `--skip-noncritical-stage` | Skip non-critical stages on failure instead of aborting |

### Examples

```bash
# Full autonomous run — no human intervention
researchclaw run -c config.yaml -t "Graph neural networks for protein folding" --auto-approve

# Resume a failed run from where it stopped
researchclaw run -c config.yaml --resume --auto-approve

# Re-run just the paper writing stages
researchclaw run -c config.yaml --from-stage PAPER_OUTLINE --auto-approve

# Check your setup before running
researchclaw doctor -c config.yaml
```

---

## 5. Understanding the 23 Stages

The pipeline runs in 8 phases. Each stage reads artifacts from previous stages and produces new ones.

### Phase A: Research Scoping

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | TOPIC_INIT | LLM formulates a SMART research goal; auto-detects GPU hardware (NVIDIA/MPS/CPU) | `goal.md`, `hardware_profile.json` |
| 2 | PROBLEM_DECOMPOSE | Breaks the goal into prioritized sub-questions | `problem_tree.md` |

### Phase B: Literature Discovery

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 3 | SEARCH_STRATEGY | Plans search queries and data sources | `search_plan.yaml`, `sources.json` |
| 4 | LITERATURE_COLLECT | Queries **real APIs** (arXiv-first, then Semantic Scholar) with expanded queries for broad coverage | `candidates.jsonl` |
| 5 | LITERATURE_SCREEN | **[Gate]** Filters by relevance and quality | `shortlist.jsonl` |
| 6 | KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACT | Extracts structured knowledge cards from each paper | `cards/` |

### Phase C: Knowledge Synthesis

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 7 | SYNTHESIS | Clusters findings, identifies research gaps | `synthesis.md` |
| 8 | HYPOTHESIS_GEN | Generates falsifiable hypotheses | `hypotheses.md` |

### Phase D: Experiment Design

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 9 | EXPERIMENT_DESIGN | **[Gate]** Designs experiment plan with baselines and metrics | `exp_plan.yaml` |
| 10 | CODE_GENERATION | LLM writes hardware-aware experiment code (adapts packages/constraints to GPU tier) | `experiment.py`, `experiment_spec.md` |
| 11 | RESOURCE_PLANNING | Estimates GPU/time requirements | `schedule.json` |

### Phase E: Experiment Execution

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 12 | EXPERIMENT_RUN | Runs the experiment code (sandbox or simulated); immutable harness injected for time guard and metric validation; partial results captured on timeout | `runs/` |
| 13 | ITERATIVE_REFINE | LLM analyzes results, improves code, re-runs (up to 10 iterations); timeout-aware prompts; NaN/divergence fast-fail; stdout truncated for context efficiency | `refinement_log.json`, `experiment_final.py` |

### Phase F: Analysis & Decision

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 14 | RESULT_ANALYSIS | Statistical analysis of experiment results | `analysis.md` |
| 15 | RESEARCH_DECISION | PROCEED / PIVOT decision with evidence | `decision.md` |

### Phase G: Paper Writing

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 16 | PAPER_OUTLINE | Creates section-level paper outline | `outline.md` |
| 17 | PAPER_DRAFT | Writes paper section-by-section (3 LLM calls, 5,000-6,500 words); **hard-blocked when no experiment metrics** (anti-fabrication); conference-grade title guidelines and abstract structure injected | `paper_draft.md` |
| 18 | PEER_REVIEW | Simulates 2+ reviewer perspectives with NeurIPS/ICML rubric (1-10 scoring); checks baselines, ablations, claims vs evidence | `reviews.md` |
| 19 | PAPER_REVISION | Addresses review comments with length guard (auto-retries if revised paper is shorter than draft) | `paper_revised.md` |

### Phase H: Finalization

| # | Stage | What Happens | Produces |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 20 | QUALITY_GATE | **[Gate]** Checks paper quality score | `quality_report.json` |
| 21 | KNOWLEDGE_ARCHIVE | Saves retrospective + reproducibility bundle | `archive.md`, `bundle_index.json` |
| 22 | EXPORT_PUBLISH | Generates LaTeX, charts, and code package | `paper_final.md`, `paper.tex`, `code/` |
| 23 | CITATION_VERIFY | Fact-checks all references against real APIs | `verification_report.json`, `references_verified.bib` |

### Gate Stages

Three stages pause for human review (unless `--auto-approve` is set):

| Gate | What's Being Reviewed | On Reject, Rolls Back To |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Stage 5 | Are the collected papers relevant and sufficient? | Stage 4 (re-collect literature) |
| Stage 9 | Is the experiment design sound? | Stage 8 (re-generate hypotheses) |
| Stage 20 | Does the paper meet quality standards? | Stage 16 (re-write from outline) |

For fully autonomous operation, always use `--auto-approve`.

## 6. Output Artifacts

Each run creates a timestamped directory under `artifacts/`:

```

---

## 7. Experiment Modes

AutoResearchClaw supports four modes for running experiments:

### Simulated (Default)

```yaml
experiment:
  mode: "simulated"
```

The LLM **generates synthetic experiment results** without executing any code. This is fast and requires no special setup, but the results are not real.

**Best for**: Quick prototyping, testing the pipeline end-to-end, environments without Python scientific packages.

### Sandbox

```yaml
experiment:
  mode: "sandbox"
  sandbox:
    python_path: ".venv/bin/python3"
    gpu_required: false
    max_memory_mb: 4096
```

The pipeline **generates Python code and actually runs it** in a subprocess. The code is validated before execution (AST parsing, import whitelist, no file I/O outside sandbox). **Hardware-aware**: Stage 1 auto-detects your GPU (NVIDIA CUDA / Apple MPS / CPU-only) and adapts the generated code accordingly — high-tier GPUs get full PyTorch code, limited GPUs get lightweight experiments, CPU-only gets NumPy/sklearn only.

**Best for**: Real experiments on your local machine. Supports numpy and stdlib; deep learning frameworks (torch, tensorflow) are available if installed in your environment and GPU is detected.

**Safety features**:
- Code validation blocks dangerous operations (subprocess, eval, exec, network calls)
- Configurable memory limit and execution timeout
- Auto-repair: if generated code has validation errors, the LLM fixes them (up to 3 attempts)

### Docker

```yaml
experiment:
  mode: "docker"
  docker:
    image: "researchclaw/experiment:latest"
    gpu_enabled: true
    memory_limit_mb: 8192
    network_policy: "setup_only"   # none | setup_only | pip_only | full
    auto_install_deps: true
    shm_size_mb: 2048
```

The pipeline runs generated code inside a **Docker container** with GPU passthrough, dependency auto-installation, and network isolation. Execution follows a **three-phase model** within a single container:

1. **Phase 0 (pip install)**: Installs auto-detected dependencies from `requirements.txt` (network enabled)
2. **Phase 1 (setup.py)**: Runs `setup.py` for dataset downloads and environment preparation (network enabled)
3. **Phase 2 (experiment)**: Executes the experiment code (network disabled by default via iptables)

**Network policies**:
- `none` — No network at all (all phases offline). Requires all deps pre-installed in image.
- `setup_only` (default) — Network during Phase 0+1, disabled before Phase 2 via iptables (`--cap-add=NET_ADMIN`).
- `pip_only` — Network only during Phase 0 (pip install), disabled for Phase 1+2.
- `full` — Network available throughout all phases.

**Pre-cached datasets**: The Docker image includes CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, FashionMNIST, STL-10, and SVHN at `/opt/datasets`, mounted read-only as `/workspace/data`. No download needed for these standard benchmarks.

**Best for**: Reproducible experiments with full dependency isolation. Supports GPU passthrough (NVIDIA) and configurable network policies.

**Setup**: Build the image first:
```bash
docker build -t researchclaw/experiment:latest researchclaw/docker/
```

### SSH Remote

```yaml
experiment:
  mode: "ssh_remote"
  ssh_remote:
    host: "gpu-server.example.com"
    gpu_ids: [0, 1]
    remote_workdir: "/tmp/researchclaw_experiments"
```

The pipeline sends generated code to a remote GPU server for execution.

**Best for**: Experiments that require GPU hardware you don't have locally.

---

## 8. Conference Templates

AutoResearchClaw generates LaTeX files formatted for specific conferences:

```yaml
export:
  target_conference: "neurips_2025"
```

| Conference | Config Value | Layout |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| NeurIPS 2025 | `neurips_2025` (default) | Single-column, `neurips_2025` style |
| NeurIPS 2024 | `neurips_2024` | Single-column, `neurips_2024` style |
| ICLR 2026 | `iclr_2026` | Single-column, `iclr2026_conference` style |
| ICLR 2025 | `iclr_2025` | Single-column, `iclr2025_conference` style |
| ICML 2026 | `icml_2026` | Double-column, `icml2026` style |
| ICML 2025 | `icml_2025` | Double-column, `icml2025` style |

Short aliases are also accepted: `neurips` (→ 2025), `iclr` (→ 2026), `icml` (→ 2026).

The Markdown-to-LaTeX converter handles:
- Section headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Inline and display math (`$...$`, `$$...$$`)
- Bold and italic text
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Tables
- Code blocks
- Citation references (`[cite_key]` → `\cite{cite_key}`)

### Compiling the LaTeX

```bash
# Using tectonic (recommended)
tectonic artifacts/<run-id>/stage-22/paper.tex

# Using pdflatex
cd artifacts/<run-id>/stage-22/
pdflatex paper.tex
bibtex paper
pdflatex paper.tex
pdflatex paper.tex
```

---

## 9. OpenClaw Bridge (Advanced)

For deeper integration with OpenClaw, AutoResearchClaw includes a bridge adapter system. Each flag in the config activates a typed protocol interface:

```yaml
openclaw_bridge:
  use_cron: true              # Scheduled research runs
  use_message: true           # Progress notifications (Discord/Slack/Telegram)
  use_memory: true            # Cross-session knowledge persistence
  use_sessions_spawn: true    # Spawn parallel sub-sessions for concurrent stages
  use_web_fetch: true         # Live web search during literature review
  use_browser: false          # Browser-based paper collection
```

### What Each Adapter Does

| Adapter | Protocol | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Cron** | `CronAdapter.schedule_resume(run_id, stage_id, reason)` | Schedule pipeline resumption (e.g., daily re-runs) |
| **Message** | `MessageAdapter.notify(channel, subject, body)` | Send progress updates to chat platforms |
| **Memory** | `MemoryAdapter.append(namespace, content)` | Persist knowledge across sessions |
| **Sessions** | `SessionsAdapter.spawn(name, command)` | Run pipeline stages in parallel sub-sessions |
| **WebFetch** | `WebFetchAdapter.fetch(url)` | Fetch web pages during literature search |
| **Browser** | `BrowserAdapter.open(url)` | Open and interact with web pages |

When OpenClaw provides a capability (e.g., message sending), the adapter consumes it automatically. When running standalone, recording stubs capture all calls for debugging without side effects.

This is an **extension point** — you don't need to configure it for basic usage.

---

## 10. Other AI Platforms

AutoResearchClaw works with any AI coding assistant that can read project context files.

### Claude Code

Claude Code automatically reads `RESEARCHCLAW_CLAUDE.md` (if present) when you open the project. It also loads the skill definition from `.claude/skills/researchclaw/SKILL.md`.

> **Note:** `RESEARCHCLAW_CLAUDE.md` is generated locally and listed in `.gitignore`. The `.claude/skills/researchclaw/SKILL.md` file is always available in the repo.

```
You: Research the impact of attention mechanisms on speech recognition
Claude: [Reads project context, runs the pipeline, returns results]
```

### OpenCode

OpenCode loads skills from `.claude/skills/`. The `researchclaw` skill activates on research-related queries and guides the agent through the pipeline.

### Any AI CLI

Provide `RESEARCHCLAW_AGENTS.md` (if generated locally) or `README.md` as context to any AI assistant. `RESEARCHCLAW_AGENTS.md` contains:
- The agent role definition (research orchestrator)
- Quick setup instructions
- Pipeline stage reference
- Decision guide for common scenarios

The agent reads this file and knows how to install, configure, and run the pipeline. If the file is not present, the `README.md` and `.claude/skills/researchclaw/SKILL.md` provide sufficient context for any AI assistant to operate the pipeline.

## 11. Python API

For programmatic use or custom integrations:

```python
from researchclaw.pipeline.runner import execute_pipeline
from researchclaw.config import RCConfig
from researchclaw.adapters import AdapterBundle
from pathlib import Path

# Load configuration
config = RCConfig.load("config.yaml", check_paths=False)

# Run the full pipeline
results = execute_pipeline(
    run_dir=Path("artifacts/my-run"),
    run_id="run-001",
    config=config,
    adapters=AdapterBundle(),
    auto_approve_gates=True,
)

# Check results
for result in results:
    print(f"Stage {result.stage.name}: {result.status.value}")
```

### Iterative Pipeline (Multiple Paper Revisions)

```python
from researchclaw.pipeline.runner import execute_iterative_pipeline

results = execute_iterative_pipeline(
    run_dir=Path("artifacts/my-run"),
    run_id="run-001",
    config=config,
    adapters=AdapterBundle(),
    max_iterations=3,       # Re-run paper writing up to 3 times
    convergence_rounds=2,   # Stop if quality stabilizes for 2 rounds
)
```

### Literature Search Only

```python
from researchclaw.literature.search import search_papers

papers = search_papers("transformer attention mechanisms", limit=20)
for p in papers:
    print(f"{p.title} ({p.year}) — cited {p.citation_count}x")
    print(p.to_bibtex())
```

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Pre-Run Diagnostics

```bash
# Check everything: Python version, dependencies, API connectivity, config validity
researchclaw doctor --config config.yaml
```

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `Missing required field: llm.base_url` | Config incomplete | Set `llm.base_url` and `llm.api_key` (or `api_key_env`) |
| `Config validation FAILED` | Invalid YAML or missing fields | Run `researchclaw validate -c config.yaml` for details |
| `Preflight check... FAILED` | LLM API unreachable | Check `base_url`, API key, and network connectivity |
| Sandbox execution fails | Python path wrong or missing packages | Verify `experiment.sandbox.python_path` exists; ensure numpy is installed |
| Code validation rejects all attempts | LLM generates unsafe code | Switch to `simulated` mode, or try a more capable model |
| Gate stage blocks pipeline | Manual approval required | Use `--auto-approve` for autonomous mode |
| Pipeline fails mid-run | Transient API error | Run with `--resume` to continue from the last checkpoint |
| Citations marked HALLUCINATED | LLM invented fake references | This is expected — Stage 23 catches these. Use `references_verified.bib` instead |
| LaTeX won't compile | Missing style packages | Install the conference style files, or use `tectonic` which auto-downloads them |

### Resuming a Failed Run

```bash
# Resume from the exact point of failure
researchclaw run -c config.yaml --resume --auto-approve

# Or restart from a specific stage
researchclaw run -c config.yaml --from-stage EXPERIMENT_RUN --auto-approve --output artifacts/<run-id>
```

### Reading a Run Report

```bash
researchclaw report --run-dir artifacts/rc-20260310-143200-a1b2c3
```

This prints a human-readable summary: which stages passed, which failed, key metrics, and paper quality scores.

## 13. FAQ

**Q: How much does a full pipeline run cost in API credits?**
A: Depends on your model and topic complexity. A typical run with GPT-4o makes ~35-60 API calls across all 23 stages (paper drafting now uses 3 sequential calls for section-by-section writing). Expect roughly $3-12 per run. Simulated mode uses slightly fewer tokens since it doesn't generate real experiment code.

**Q: Can I use a local LLM (Ollama, vLLM, etc.)?**
A: Yes — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works. Set `llm.base_url` to your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama). Quality depends heavily on the model's capabilities.

**Q: Can I run only part of the pipeline?**
A: Yes. Use `--from-stage STAGE_NAME` to start from any stage. The stage reads its inputs from previously generated artifacts, so the earlier stages must have completed at least once.

**Q: Are the literature references real?**
A: Yes. Stage 4 uses a multi-source strategy (arXiv-first, then Semantic Scholar) with query expansion to find real papers with real titles, DOIs, and citation counts. The pipeline typically collects 100-200 candidates and aims for 30-60 references in the final paper. Stage 23 then verifies every reference to catch any that the LLM might have hallucinated during paper writing.

**Q: Can I use this for a real paper submission?**
A: AutoResearchClaw is a research tool, not a paper mill. The output is a strong first draft that should be reviewed, improved, and validated by a human researcher before submission. Think of it as an extremely thorough research assistant.

**Q: What happens if the LLM API goes down mid-run?**
A: The pipeline checkpoints after every stage. Use `--resume` to pick up where it left off. Failed stages are retried according to the `max_retries` setting in each stage's contract.

**Q: Can I change the research topic mid-run?**
A: Not recommended — the pipeline builds on prior stages' outputs. Start a new run with the new topic instead.
