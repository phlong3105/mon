# VIPriors Action Recognition Challenge - Baseline

We provide a random chance baseline as a starting point for participants. It simply assigns random labels to clips. The script to generate the results of this baseline can be found in the `chance/` folder, inside this directory. You can check the result file of this baseline as guide to create yours. 

We show, in the table below, the performance of the baseline on the validation set

| Baseline | Top-1 Accuracy (%) | Top-3 Accuracy (%) | Top-5 Accuracy (%) |
| :------: | :----------------: | :----------------: | :----------------: |
|  chance  |       0.241        |       0.631        |       1.072        |
