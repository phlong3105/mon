# `mon` Core Guidelines

---

## Introduction 

Python is the main dynamic language used in this project. This style guide is a
list of dos and don’ts for Python programs.

Most of the guidelines here are adopted
from [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

---

## 1. Import

Rules:

- **Use import statements for packages and modules only, not for individual
  classes or functions.**
- Use `import x` for importing packages and modules.
- Use `from x import y` where `x` is the package prefix and y is the module name
  with no prefix.

  ```python
  from sound.effects import echo
  
  echo.EchoFilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)
  ```

- Use `from x import y as z` if two modules named `y` are to be imported, if `y`
  conflicts with a top-level name defined in the current module, or if `y` is an
  inconveniently long name.
- Use `import y as z` only when `z` is a standard abbreviation (e.g., `np` for
  `numpy`).
- Do not use relative names in imports. Even if the module is in the same
  package, use the full package name. This helps prevent unintentionally
  importing a package twice.

Exemption:

- `abc` module
- `typing` module, including both Python's built-in and custom typing modules.
- `typing_extensions` module
- `globals` module. This module contains all user-defined globals like
  constants, enum, type alias

---

## 2. Packaging Layout

Rules:

- Use the `src` layout.
  ```
  sample
  ├── docs/
  ├── src/
  │   └── sample/
  │       ├── __init__.py
  │       └── module.py
  ├── tools/
  │   └── generate_awesomeness.py
  ├── test/
  ├── README.md
  ├── pyproject.toml
  ```

Advantages:

- The `src` layout requires installation of the project to be able to run its
  code.
- The `src` layout helps prevent accidental usage of the in-development copy of
  the code.
- The `src` layout helps enforce that an editable installation is only able to
  import files that were meant to be importable.

---

## 3. Naming Convention

`module_name`, `package_name`, `ClassName`, `method_name`, `ExceptionName`,
`function_name`, `GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME`, `global_var_name`, `instance_var_name`,
`function_parameter_name`, `local_var_name`, `query_proper_noun_for_thing`,
`send_acronym_via_https`.

---

## 4. Naming: Singular or Plural

Rules:

- For `module_name`, `package_name`, ClassName` uses **singular nouns**, except
  for words that don't have singular forms (i.e., news, weights, etc.).
- For `GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME`, `global_var_name`, `instance_var_name`,
  `function_parameter_name`, `local_var_name` use proper plural nouns.

Reasons:

- **Reason 1 (Convenience)**: It is easier come out with singular names. Objects
  can have irregular plurals or not plural at all, but will always have a
  singular one (with few exceptions like news).
- **Reason 2 (Order)**: Especially in master-detail scenarios, this reads
  better, aligns better by name, and has more logical order (Master first,
  Detail second):
  ```
  Good:
    1. Order
    2. OrderDetail 
   
  Bad:
    1. OrderDetails
    2. Orders
    3. OrdersDetails
  ```

## 5. Naming: Abbreviation

Rules:

- **FOLLOW** the naming convention of the third-party library that you are
  trying to extend or inherit.
  - Use `input` and `output` for PyTorch forward methods. Other cases, use `in` 
  	and `out`.
  - Use `img` in OpenCV functions.
  - Use `x` for generic no-name argument. Mostly in built-in or math functions.
  - Use `y` for the second generic no-name argument. Mostly built-in or math
    functions.
  - Use `src` and `dst` for generic functions: `copy(src, dst)`. Mostly in file
    I/O functions.
  
- Avoid Python reserved keywords. See
  more: [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
- Use abbreviation if:
	- `global` for understood by everyone
	- `significant` for seen for the first time you still know what it means
	- `absolute` for not related to the context
	- `short` for taking out one letter isn't an abbreviation

## 6. Naming: Functions & Methods

Rules:

- **Obtainment:**
	- Use `get` to obtain a resource.
	- Use `read` when acquiring data from a source. Use together with `write`.
	- Use `search` to look for an unknown data from multiple containers.
	- Use `close` when changing state of a resource to make it inaccessible or
	  unusable. Use together with `open`.

- **Creation:**
	- Use `create` when creating a resource. Ex: `create_dir()`.
	- Use `X.from()` when creating an instance of class `X` from a value.
	  Ex: `List.from_string()`.
	- Use `copy` when creating a resource with the same structure and data as
	  the original one.

- **Alteration:**
	- Use `set` to put data in an existing resource such as an attribute of an
	  object.
	- Use `change` when a whole thing, such as image, is replaced by something
	  else.
	- Use `edit` similar as `change`. It could be used, especially when action
	  is responsible for rendering the view.
	- Use `update` when one or more of the components is updated as a result,
	  and something new could also be added.
	- Use `add` to add something into a group of the things.
	- Use `append` similar as `add`. It could be used when it doesn't modify the
	  original group of things, but produce the new group.
	- Use `remove` when a given thing is removed from a group of the things.
	- Use `delete` to eliminate the object or group of things.
	- Use `write` when preserving data to an external source. Use together
	  with `read`.
	- Use `disable` to configure a resource an unavailable or inactive state.
	- Use `split` when separating parts of a resource.
	- Use `merge` when creating a single resource from multiple resources.
	- Use `join` similar as `merge` but for data and values.

- **Conversion:**
	- Use `to` when converting a variable from arbitrary types to the desired
	  type. Ex: `to_list()`.
	- Use `x_to_y` when converting a variable from type `a` to type `b`.
	  Ex: `str_to_int()`.

- **Establishment:**
	- Use `start` when initiating an operation. Ex: `start_listening()`.
	- Use `stop` when ending an operation. Ex: `stop_listening()`.
	- Use `open` when changing state of a resource to make it accessible or
	  usable
	  Use together with `close`. Ex: `open_file()`.

- **True or False Statement:**
	- Use `is` when defining state of a resource. Ex: `is_available()`.
	- Use `has` to define whether a resource contains a certain data.
	  Ex: `has_name()`.]
	- Use `can` to define a certain ability of a resource.
	- Use `should` to define a certain obligation of a resource.

- **Using noun for function name:**
	- function is always expected to perform an action. **If it barely returns a
	  value, it should be a property**.
	- You have a hint that the function should be transformed into a property
	  when:
		- The function barely contains a `return ...` statement,
		- The function's name, which comes naturally into your mind
		  is `get_something`,
		  as in `product.get_price()` --> `product.price()`.

## 7. Naming: Package

Rules:

- Package names should be all lower cases.
- It is usually preferable to stick to one word name. When multiple words are
  needed, an underscore should separate them.
- Use a noun as the name of the package because a package contains related
  modules and represents a thing or concept, which can be easily represented by
  a noun.
- Use a verb as the name of the package if the package provides a specific
  action or operation. For example, the package "pytest" is a testing framework
  for Python and uses the verb "test" in its name to clearly show its purpose.
- When stuck with coming up with a name for a package. Follow Apple's framework
  naming. See more: [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologies).

## 8. Naming: Module

Rules:

- Module names should be all lower cases.
- It is usually preferable to stick to one word name. When multiple words are
  needed, an underscore should separate them.

---

## 9. List and Tuple

Rules:

- Use `list` because it is the standard data type used in many libraries.
  When in doubt, use `list`.
- `list` supports many useful functions such as `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc.

---

## 10. Type Hint

Rules:

- DO NOT overuse it when coding. Think about it while refactoring your code.
- Use the suffix `Like` for union type that representing objects that can be
  coerced into a certain type. Example: `DictLike`.

---

## 11. `assert`, `raise`, `except`

Rules:

- Use `raise` to raise an exception.
	- Use `raise` to deal with value checking.
- Use `assert` to raise an exception if a given condition is meet.
	- Use `assert` for runtime debugging than normal runtime error detection.
	- Place assertions at the beginning of functions to check if the input is
	  valid (preconditions).
	- Place assertions before functions’ return values to check if the output is
	  valid (postconditions).
	- The best scenario is not using `assert`. If you name your function or
	  method good enough, you don't need to assert.
- Use `try` to execute some code that might raise an exception, and if so, catch
  it.
	- Use `try` for files and database I/O operations.
